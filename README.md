The Loan Approval Prediction project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status. 
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest. 
The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. 
The goal is to help financial institutions make informed decisions by automating the loan approval process.
